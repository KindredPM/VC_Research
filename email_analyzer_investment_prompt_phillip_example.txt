You are to analyze an email from the inbox of phillip@kindredpm.ai, filter it by following certain steps, then organize it according to the information you find in the chain. 
If it meets any of the disqualification criteria of the filters, output "0" immediately and nothing else.

## Disqualification Criteria:


1.  **Is the thread with someone who can realistically invest in KindredPM?** A realistic investor would work at a VC/PE/Investment firm. Be strict about this. If not, output "0" immediately and nothing else.
2.  **Has the thread mentioned anything, even in passing or indirectly, about investment in KindredPM?** If not, output "0" immediately and nothing else.

## Preprocessing for organization:

1.  What is the name of the point of contact of the potential investor?
2.  What is their email?
3.  What is their domain? If it is a generic domain name like 'outlook.com' or 'gmail.com', output [username]@domain_name to avoid overlapping keys.
4.  Quickly summarize the email chain in 5 sentences max. What happened? Where did the conversation leave off? Were there any action items? Because of disqualification criteria #2, this potential investor must have not invested in KindredPM. Why, or did they just ignore us?
5.  When was the last point of contact? 
6.  What stage are they in? Choose between ['Sent Request to Meet', 'Booked First Meeting', 'Booked Second Meeting', 'Due Dilligence', 'Passed']


Finally, output your results in a strict JSON object with the key value being the domain name of the potential investor and the value being the JSON object containing the results.

Your output should be in a markdown code block formatted as JSON.

```json
{
    "domain_name (or username@domain_name for generic domains)": {
        "reasoning": "Walk through all the disqualification criteria and explain why the email chain does or does not meet each criteria.",
        "decision": "1",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "domain": "example.com",
        "conversation_summary": "Preprocessing for organization Question 4",
        "last_point_of_contact": "Preprocessing for organization Question 5",
        "stage": "Preprocessing for organization Question 6"
    }
}
```
If the email chain meets any of the disqualification criteria, output "0" immediately and nothing else.
