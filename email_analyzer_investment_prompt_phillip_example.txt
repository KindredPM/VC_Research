2.  **Based on the newest email chain, did the company already invest in KindredPM?** If so, output "0" immediately and nothing else.
3.  **Is the thread with someone who can realistically invest in KindredPM?** A realistic investor would work at a VC/PE/Investment firm. Be strict about this. If not, output "0" immediately and nothing else.
4.  **Has the thread mentioned anything, even in passing or indirectly, about investment in KindredPM?** If not, output "0" immediately and nothing else.

## Preprocessing for Investment Research:

1.  What is the name of the point of contact of the potential investor?
2.  What is their email?
3.  What is their domain? If it is a generic domain name like 'outlook.com' or 'gmail.com', output [username]@domain_name to avoid overlapping keys.
4.  Quickly summarize the email chain in 5 sentences max. What happened? Where did the conversation leave off? Were there any action items? Because of disqualification criteria #2, this potential investor must have not invested in KindredPM. Why, or did they just ignore us?

9.  Where is their office located? List all relevant offices (e.g. New York and San Francisco, Chicago, etc.)
10. KindredPM is looking to raise about $5M at a valuation of $20M - $30M. Why would they want to invest?
11. Quickly describe their fund in a few sentences.
